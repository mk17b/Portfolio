					<p>
						My journey into development began in a school computer lab, where I built simple games in Scratch just for the fun of it. That spark quickly turned into a flame when I enrolled in an Android programming class, also at school — it was there I created my first full app: a quiz game that brought everything together for the first time. From then on, I was hooked.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						That early curiosity set me on a clear path. I started my professional career sharpening my skills in Java, then dove headfirst into the .NET ecosystem and Angular, learning to navigate both front and back-end complexity. Every project pushed me to write cleaner code, design smarter systems, and think beyond the task at hand.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Today, I build full-stack applications that are fast, reliable, and built to last. I’ve tackled legacy codebases, improved load performance, and helped shape architectures that scale. I care deeply about simplicity, thoughtful design, and building software that feels solid — not just in how it runs, but in how it’s built.
